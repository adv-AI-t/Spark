# Apache Spark

## Overview

This repository contains the datasets and programs in Python (pyspark), to use Apache Spark.
I am building this repository by parallelly executing the exercises and tasks in the Udemy Course - Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python.

## Run Spark on your Machine

Requirements: 
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- Python
- Spark

After downloading spark (e.g.: spark-3.5.3-bin-hadoop3.tgz) unzip the file to extract the folder (e.g.: spark-3.5.3-bin-hadoop3)

```bash
cd spark-3.5.3-bin-hadoop3
